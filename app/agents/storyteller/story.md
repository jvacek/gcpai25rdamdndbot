# Rage of the Chained

*An adventure for four 5th-level characters (APL 5). Completing it should bring them halfway to level 6.*

Taken captive, the characters are forced to fight in an arena. This campaign takes place in **Arden**, but it can easily be set in your own world. Any party composition can complete the adventure with intelligent play.

---

## Background

The **Arena of Azago** is known far and wide for its bloodshed and violent entertainment. Cities across Arden send their most dangerous prisoners there to deter crime.

Recently, a convict known only as **The Lion** has slain every opponent sent against him. Fearing he may inspire rebellion, the arena’s owner sends bounty hunters to find new blood — anyone with a bounty or who looks like a good fighter.

Will the Lion finally fall, or continue his reign?

---

## Adventure Hooks

- **Wanted:** The characters are criminals, and mercenaries capture them for the arena.
- **Mistaken Identity:** They’re mistaken for wanted fugitives and taken anyway.
- **Wrong Place, Wrong Time:** They cross paths with mercenaries indiscriminately collecting “fighters.”

---

## Ambushed!

> *You find yourselves traveling along the king's road at midday...*

Have the characters make a **DC 18 Wisdom (Perception)** check. Those who fail are surprised as **three assassins**, a **mage**, and **two half-red dragon veterans** attack from the trees.
The mercenaries make **non-lethal attacks**. The encounter ends only once all characters are captured.

---

## Imprisoned

> *You awaken inside a dark cell...*

They meet **Taziz**, the arena’s noble owner. Their equipment is gone, replaced by **metal collars** set with gems.

### Magic Collars

- Prevent the wearer from casting spells of 6th-level or lower.
- Taziz can (as an action) force wearers to make a **DC 25 Constitution save** or fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.
- Can be unlocked with a **DC 25 Arcana check** (disadvantage if wearing one).
- The arena is **teleport-warded**; you can’t teleport in or out.

Taziz offers freedom — and payment — if they defeat **The Lion**, but they must first survive **three preliminary bouts** to earn fame.

## The Arena

A **large rectangular pit**, 15 ft. high walls, enclosed by a **permanent Wall of Force** (60 ft high).
Taziz has installed traps for “excitement”:

- **4× Whirling Blades** – DC 15 Dex save or 3d10 slashing.
- **1× Acid Pool** – 15 ft deep, 6d6 acid damage at start of turn.
- **3× Surprise Chests** – Two boons, one trap (random each bout).

> *The lights dim as you enter the arena...*

**Opponents:**
- *Zulaevia* (Medusa)
- *Minos & Corpos* (2× Giant Scorpions, blinded but have blindsight)

Tactics: scorpions charge first; Zulaevia attacks with longbow, then reveals her face within 30 ft to petrify, switching to melee.

---

## Bout Two: *Sinister Skies*

> *The roof opens above you...*

**Opponents:**
- *Lag’Grex the Vicious* (Chimera)
- *3× Harpies*
- *2× Cockatrices*

Chimera attacks fearlessly. Harpies begin with *Luring Song*, then dive-attack. Cockatrices dart around biting.

---

## Bout Three: *The Dead Rise*

> *The arena is pitch black...*

**Opponents:**
- *1× Wraith*
- *2× Specters*
- *3× Shadows*

Two chests are trapped; one has a boon.

| Boon | Trap |
|-------|------|
| *Suntorch* (sunlight 1 hr/day) | Cloud of darkness, 40 ft radius, DC 15 Con save or 4d6 necrotic (silence & heavily obscured). |

---

## Final Bout: *The Lion’s Den*

That night, the heroes dine lavishly. Taziz tells them they will face **The Lion** and his band.
In the morning, roll a **d6** for each hero for a temporary boon (lasts until next rest):

| d6 | Boon |
|----|------|
| 1 | Gain 2d8 temp HP |
| 2 | +1 AC |
| 3 | +1d4 to saves |
| 4 | +1d4 to ability checks |
| 5 | +1d4 to attack rolls |
| 6 | Roll twice (more boons) |

**Opponents:**

- *The Lion* (Gladiator with Legendary Actions)
- *Acolyte*
- *Druid*
- *Bandit Captain*
- *Spy*

### The Lion’s Legendary Actions

- **Tactical Maneuver (1 action):** Move half speed (no AoO).
- **Show of Strength (1 action):** DC 15 Str save or be knocked prone, pushed 10 ft, or left off-balance.
- **Lion’s Roar (2 actions, Recharge 5-6):** Allies gain 3d6 temp HP; enemies in 30 ft make DC 15 Wis save or become *frightened* for 1 min.

---

## Victorious at Last!

If the characters slay The Lion, the crowd erupts.
Taziz appears:

> “After reigning supreme for many seasons, The Lion has finally been bested! … I hereby grant these warriors their freedom!”

The party earns **500 gp per bout**, or the “Encore” reward if applicable.
Their collars are removed, and they become free adventurers once more.

---

## Aftermath

With gold and glory, the heroes can continue in the arena or seek new adventures.
Beware: The Lion’s supporters may seek revenge.
